##Paradox Node Editor
Paradox Node Editor is a desktop application created to assist and ease the development of EU4 and HOI4 mods. Working on my mod: Lord of Universalis I found it tedious to work with mission trees (especially large ones), without any visual representation outside the one inside the game. This led to me opening and closing of EU4 many times during development just to view my mission tree changes, and each time taking as close to 5 minutes to load the game and start each time. This application offers the following features:<br />
- Now Supports: EU4 Missions, HOI4 Focus Trees
- Create, Import and Export: Mission(EU4), Focustree(HOI4) Files
- Visual Graph editor which lets you move and connect missions/focuses together.
- Create Missions/Focus and Mission Series/Focus tree and edit all their variables.
- Assign a Color to a Mission Series/Focus to easily identify them.
- Checks and warnings if using same mission/focus names.
- Workspaces that can remember your exported files and will load them on start of the application.
- Check for Application Updates, Download and install them with ease through the application.
- Light and Dark Mode

Installation Guide:
Choose the Latest release version on the github release page.
Download the Paradox-Mission-Editor-Setup-x.x.x.exe (x are version number).
Run the Setup process.<br />
As with using any 3rd Party tools, backing your files up is crucial. I won’t guarantee that your mission/focus file is always exported correctly, and therefore I don’t recommend only working with one version of your mission/focus file.
Few notes on Importing and Exporting:
As of now comments are not imported and will therefore not be exported.
If your mission/focus file cannot be imported, it can be caused by formatting issues. I recommend using inline brackets as this has the highest chance of being imported correctly.<br />

The Application was created using a Javascript Framework called Electron together with a Frontend Framework called ‘Create React App’. The Application does not use or require internet connection, aside from checking and downloading updates.<br />

The Application is called Paradox Node Editor because I want to leave it open to also include other Paradox Games into the editor(EU4, HOI4 Support as of now). Let me know if this would be interesting to you, and I will consider it.
