##Paradox Node Editor
Paradox Node Editor is a desktop application created to assist and ease the development of EU4 mods. Working on my mod: Lord of Universalis I found it tedious to work with mission trees (especially large ones), without any visual representation outside the one inside the game. This led to me opening and closing of EU4 many times during development just to view my mission tree changes each time taking close to 5 minutes to load the game each time. This application offers the following features:<br />
- Create, Import and Export Mission Files
- Visual Graph editor which lets you move and connect missions together.
- Create Missions and Mission Series and edit all their variables.
- Assign a Color to a Mission Series to easily identify them.
- Checks and warnings if using same mission names.
- Check for Application Updates, Download and install them with ease through the application.
- Light and Dark Mode

Installation Guide:
Choose the Latest release version on the github release page.
Download the Paradox-Mission-Editor-Setup-x.x.x.exe (x are version number).
Run the Setup process.<br />
As with using any 3rd Party tools, backing your files up is crucial. I won’t guarantee that your mission file is always exported correctly, and therefore I don’t recommend only working with one version of your mission file.
Few notes on Importing and Exporting:
As of now comments are not imported and will therefore not be exported.
If your mission file cannot be imported, it can be caused by formatting issues. I recommend using inline brackets as this has the highest chance of being imported correctly.<br />

The Application was created using a Javascript Framework called Electron together with a Frontend Framework called ‘Create React App’. The Application does not use or require internet connection, aside from checking and downloading updates.<br />
